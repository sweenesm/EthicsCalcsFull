# EthicsCalcsFull
Project Description =================== Python code that calculates the
most ethical (most net value building) decision in a given scenario.

This is a working but unfinished proof-of-concept code that includes a full
"minimal" set of possible value changes (destructions and builds). It can be
used for calculating the most ethical decision, such as in the "trolley 
problem," but results should be taken with a grain of salt since the value 
weight equations/parameters are as yet not fully refined/optimized.

Two files are used by this code: ValueChangeMinSet.txt, and an input file, 
for instance, InputTrolley1.txt. These files are included in this repot.

The Python version used was 3.9.13.
